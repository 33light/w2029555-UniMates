## Project Overview
UniMates is a student-only mobile application designed to support university students by providing a centralised platform for academic and social interaction.

The application aims to improve campus connectivity and student collaboration through three main features:

• Student Marketplace – Allows students to buy, sell, and trade textbooks, electronics, and other items within the university community.  
• Community Posting – Allows students to share information, academic support, tips, and university events.  
• Lost and Found – Allows students to report lost items and browse found item listings across campus.
