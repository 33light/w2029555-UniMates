### State Management Pattern
```dart
✅ EXCELLENT PATTERNS:
- FutureBuilder for async data (marketplace feed)
- Proper pagination state variables (_currentPage, _pageSize, etc.)
- Filter state management with setState
- Debouncing with _isLoadingMore flag
- mounted checks before setState (prevents crashes)
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (15 scenarios)

#### Feed Scenarios
- [ ] Load feed for first time (should show 10 items)
- [ ] Scroll to bottom (should load next 10 items)
- [ ] Scroll to bottom twice (should stop loading after ~20-30 items)
- [ ] Pull to refresh (should reset and reload)
- [ ] Tap item card (should navigate to detail screen)

#### Search & Filter Scenarios
- [ ] Open filter sheet (should show all options)
- [ ] Search by keyword (should filter results)
- [ ] Filter by category (should show only that category)
- [ ] Filter by type (Sell/Buy/Borrow/Exchange)
- [ ] Filter by price range (should exclude items outside range)
- [ ] Combine multiple filters (all should apply together)
- [ ] Clear filters (should reset and reload all items)
- [ ] Apply filters then scroll (pagination should respect filters)

#### Item Detail Scenarios
- [ ] View item details (should show all information)
- [ ] Swipe between images (should change image)
- [ ] Tap on sold item (should show sold overlay)
- [ ] Tap "Message Seller" (should show coming soon - Phase 4)
- [ ] Tap "Add to Favorites" (should show confirmation - Phase 5)

### Automated Tests (To Add)
- [ ] Unit tests for filter logic
- [ ] Widget tests for card rendering
- [ ] Integration tests for pagination
- [ ] Mock API tests

## 📝 Code Examples

### Example 1: Filtering Items
```dart
// Apply price range filter
final minPrice = 50.0;
final maxPrice = 500.0;

final filteredItems = await apiService.getMarketplaceItems(
  minPrice: minPrice,
  maxPrice: maxPrice,
  pageSize: 10,
);
```

### Example 2: Pagination
```dart
// Automatically load next page when scrolling
void _onScroll() {
  if (_scrollController.position.pixels >= 
      _scrollController.position.maxScrollExtent - 500) {
    _loadMoreItems();
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Image Carousel
```dart
// Navigate between images in item detail
PageView.builder(
  controller: _imageController,
  onPageChanged: (index) {
    setState(() => _currentImageIndex = index);
  },
  itemCount: item.imageUrls.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => Image.network(item.imageUrls[index]),
)
```
