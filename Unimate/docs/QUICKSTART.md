flutter pub get

# 2. Run the app
flutter run

# 3. Test Authentication
  - Click "Sign Up"
  - Enter email: test@example.com

# 4. You should see the Home screen!

# 5. Test Logout
  - Click logout icon in top right
  - You're back at login screen
  
# 6. Test Login

  - Click "Login" button
  - Should see Home screen again
```

## 🔐 To Enable Google Sign-In (Optional)

Google Sign-In requires **platform-specific configuration**. This is a separate setup:

### Quick Setup (15-30 min)

1. **Get your debug SHA-1 fingerprint**
   ```bash
   cd android
   # For Windows, try:
   .\gradlew signingReport
   
   # Or use Android Studio Tools → Android → Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   # Or see GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md for alternatives
   ```
   Copy the SHA-1 value

2. **Add SHA-1 to Firebase Console**
   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select project: **chatter-via-flutter**
   - Go to Settings → Your Apps → Android app
   - Click "Add Fingerprint"
   - Paste your SHA-1

3. **Add iOS URL Scheme (if using iOS)**
   - In Firebase Console, get your **Reverse Client ID**
   - Edit `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
   - Add this under `<dict>` root:
   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
     <dict>
       <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
       <array>
         <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_REVERSE_CLIENT_ID</string>
       </array>
     </dict>
   </array>
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_REVERSE_CLIENT_ID` with actual value

4. **Test Google Sign-In**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   - Click "Sign in with Google" button
   - Select your Google account
   - Should redirect to Home screen

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Sign Up/Login not working"
- Check internet connection (Firebase needs it)
- Check Firebase project is active in Firebase Console
- Check email format (must contain @)
- Check password (minimum 8 characters)

### "Google Sign-In button shows but doesn't work"
- You need to complete the platform setup (see Google Sign-In section above)
- Android needs SHA-1 added to Firebase
- iOS needs Info.plist URL scheme configured

### "App won't start"
- Run: `flutter pub get`
- Run: `flutter clean`
- Run: `flutter pub get` again
- Then: `flutter run`

### "Image not found for chatbubble.png"
- This is just a warning if the asset doesn't exist
- The app will still work fine
- Add your image to `assets/images/chatbubble.png` to fix it

## 💡 Key Files to Know

- **`lib/screens/auth.dart`** - All authentication UI and logic
- **`lib/screens/home.dart`** - Home screen (where you'll add chat features)

## ✨ You're All Set!

Your authentication system is **production-ready** (for email/password).

**Email/Password testing:** Works immediately without any setup!  
**Google Sign-In:** Optional - requires 15-30 min of Firebase Console setup if you want it.

Happy coding! 🎉
